#Online Payment Fraud Detection System
This project provides an interactive web application built with Streamlit for detecting fraudulent transactions in online payment systems. Leveraging a trained Random Forest machine learning model, the system enables both manual single transaction input and bulk transaction processing via CSV upload with detailed fraud detection, prevention advice, and data visualizations.

Features:

Real-time fraud prediction based on transaction attributes like amount, origin/destination balances, and flags.

Bulk fraud detection through CSV file uploads for efficient batch processing.

Interactive visualizations and detailed insights into transaction data and fraud patterns.

User-friendly interface with multi-page navigation covering overview, model details, fraud insights, and results.

Downloadable CSV reports summarizing fraud detection results and prevention recommendations.

Technologies Used:

Python 3.8+

Streamlit for UI

scikit-learn Random Forest for fraud prediction

Pandas and Altair for data processing and visualization
